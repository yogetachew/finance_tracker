## Week 1: Project Setup & Basic Income/Expense Tracking
In the first week, I set up the Personal Finance Tracker project in Python. The main focus was to create a command-line interface (CLI) where users can add income and expenses, store them in a CSV file, and view past transactions.

## Key Features Implemented:
- Created a GitHub repository and set up a .gitignore file.
- Designed a basic project structure with main.py (CLI) and tracker.py (data management).
- Implemented functions to add transactions (income/expenses) and view transaction history.
- Used CSV file storage to keep track of financial records.
- Added basic input validation and error handling.

## Week 2 Update
I updated the CSV file to include a **Month** column so transactions can be tracked by month. I also added categories like Food, Rent, and Transport in **tracker.py** so users can select a category instead of typing it. To make things easier, I changed **main.py** to help users pick a category quickly, making the program simpler to use.

I will also be adding **budget.py** to the project. This file will help me set a **budget limit** for different categories like Food, Rent, and Transport. It will also track the **remaining balance** for each category so I can see how much I have left to spend. This will make it easier for me to manage my money and avoid overspending.
