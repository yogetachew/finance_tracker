## Week 1: Project Setup & Basic Income/Expense Tracking
In the first week, I set up the Personal Finance Tracker project in Python. The main focus was to create a command-line interface (CLI) where users can add income and expenses, store them in a CSV file, and view past transactions.

## Key Features Implemented:
- Created a GitHub repository and set up a .gitignore file.
- Designed a basic project structure with main.py (CLI) and tracker.py (data management).
- Implemented functions to add transactions (income/expenses) and view transaction history.
- Used CSV file storage to keep track of financial records.
- Added basic input validation and error handling.
